# Cat Butt
 A horrible Pygame demonstration of rects and moving images


Use WASD to control the cat, move your mouse to get it's position.

Spent far longer on this than I would care to admit.

As long as DEBUG is true it will display FPS,  X and Y of the Cat Butt and if the mouse is clicked it will "print" the mouse x, y
in the console
